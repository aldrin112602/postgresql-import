- In your Integrated terminal:
```bash

```
- The first command installs the `tkinter` library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces with Tkinter. 
- The second command installs the `psycopg2` library, which is a `PostgreSQL` adapter for `Python` and is used in your code to interact with a `PostgreSQL` database.
